1
00:01:02,496 --> 00:01:04,328
What a way to die.

2
00:01:04,398 --> 00:01:05,525
Mauled to death.

3
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:07,363
Henry.

4
00:01:08,368 --> 00:01:09,679
You don't know
that's what happened.

5
00:01:09,703 --> 00:01:11,501
You didn't see it, George.

6
00:01:11,572 --> 00:01:13,404
Those terrible scratches
on his face alone

7
00:01:13,473 --> 00:01:16,238
- would let you know if you did.
- Sir.

8
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:20,845
- What have you, George?
- Sir, the man who discovered him

9
00:01:21,114 --> 00:01:22,582
was checking his
snares this morning.

10
00:01:22,649 --> 00:01:25,642
He seemed surprised,
almost disappointed,

11
00:01:25,719 --> 00:01:27,585
to find that he'd
snagged a human.

12
00:01:27,654 --> 00:01:29,850
I suppose he was
expecting his dinner.

13
00:01:30,123 --> 00:01:32,422
His "Dinner"

14
00:01:32,492 --> 00:01:34,358
Right. Have him come down
to the station house for a word.
