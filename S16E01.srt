00:00:46,056 --> 00:00:47,255
You know what, George?

6
00:00:48,191 --> 00:00:49,642
I think it's time
we get married.

7
00:00:49,726 --> 00:00:51,011
Married?

8
00:00:51,095 --> 00:00:52,178
But he can't!

9
00:00:52,262 --> 00:00:53,929
Now, come give
your father a hug.

10
00:00:54,194 --> 00:00:56,913
What kind of hold does
that man have on you?

11
00:00:56,997 --> 00:00:58,551
So, you expect me
to keep your secret?

12
00:00:58,635 --> 00:01:00,453
- I keep yours.
- You're threatening me?

13
00:01:00,537 --> 00:01:02,217
We've all got secrets, Watts.

14
00:01:02,676 --> 00:01:05,144
No one likes having
them exposed.

15
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:11,431
Should anyone know
of any reason that this couple

16
00:01:11,515 --> 00:01:14,200
should not be joined
in holy matrimony,

17
00:01:14,284 --> 00:01:17,503
speak now or forever
hold your peace.

18
00:01:17,782 --> 00:01:19,516
(Both): You?!

19
00:01:20,290 --> 00:01:23,241
(♪)

20
00:01:26,596 --> 00:01:27,830
George...

21
00:01:28,271 --> 00:01:30,171
What do you want to do?

22
00:01:34,938 --> 00:01:37,190
How long are we expected
to stay here?

23
00:01:37,274 --> 00:01:38,624
(Door opening)

24
00:01:38,708 --> 00:01:40,142
Effie's gone home.

25
00:01:40,709 --> 00:01:43,743
I suppose it's safe now
for you to leave, as well.

26
00:01:45,582 --> 00:01:49,250
You don't have anything you
want to say about any of this?

27
00:01:53,775 --> 00:01:56,377
- I'm sorry.
- Hollow words.

28
00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:00,913
She loved you, you know,
and she is my dearest friend.

29
00:02:00,997 --> 00:02:04,799
"I'm sorry" is hardly enough.

30
00:02:10,307 --> 00:02:11,658
Right then, Crab Tree.

31
00:02:11,742 --> 00:02:13,375
Let's get out of here.

32
00:02:17,114 --> 00:02:18,875
I had no choice.

33
00:02:23,053 --> 00:02:24,537
I had no choice.

34
00:02:24,621 --> 00:02:27,540
You left that poor woman
standing at the altar.

35
00:02:27,624 --> 00:02:29,938
I thought you were a better
man than that, Crab Tree.

36
00:02:31,595 --> 00:02:34,562
Is there something you would
like to tell us, George?

37
00:02:35,499 --> 00:02:37,132
Anything at all?

38
00:02:38,268 --> 00:02:39,502
(Sighing)

39
00:02:46,309 --> 00:02:47,543
George?

40
00:02:54,151 --> 00:02:55,385
(Door closing)

41
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:02,909
We didn't mean it
to be so dramatic.

42
00:03:02,993 --> 00:03:05,578
Oleander and I tried
to get here earlier.

43
00:03:05,662 --> 00:03:07,595
Why are you apologizing?

44
00:03:08,398 --> 00:03:10,717
We just saved that
young woman's life.

45
00:03:10,801 --> 00:03:12,084
And destroyed mine.

46
00:03:12,168 --> 00:03:15,370
If you had married her,
she would have died.

47
00:03:15,806 --> 00:03:18,106
It was foretold.

48
00:03:22,746 --> 00:03:23,980
I know.

49
00:03:25,549 --> 00:03:28,517
(Dog barking and panting)

50
00:03:40,497 --> 00:03:42,397
Don't be disturbing
that, girl.

51
00:03:46,837 --> 00:03:49,070
(Faint knocking)

52
00:03:51,174 --> 00:03:53,041
Good lord. Help!

53
00:03:53,744 --> 00:03:54,761
Anyone. Help!

54
00:03:54,845 --> 00:03:56,196
(Dramatic music)

55
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,530
Just a minute more.

56
00:03:57,614 --> 00:03:58,965
We'll get you out!

57
00:03:59,049 --> 00:04:01,416
(Grunting)

58
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:04,118
(Wood creaking)

59
00:04:06,657 --> 00:04:08,023
(Groaning)
(Cracking)

60
00:04:09,726 --> 00:04:11,244
(Eerie music)

61
00:04:11,328 --> 00:04:13,580
No, sir. Please! No!

62
00:04:13,664 --> 00:04:15,163
(Cracking)

63
00:04:19,169 --> 00:04:20,502
(Dog whining)

64
00:04:23,206 --> 00:04:24,440
(Whistling)

65
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:28,777
(Eerie music)

66
00:04:45,128 --> 00:04:47,180
Have the bodies taken
to the morgue, Henry.

67
00:04:47,264 --> 00:04:48,814
Of course, sir.
Although Mrs. Hart

68
00:04:48,898 --> 00:04:50,465
is away until tomorrow morning.

69
00:04:51,101 --> 00:04:52,801
Are you suggesting we wait?

70
00:04:53,037 --> 00:04:54,154
Of course not.

71
00:04:54,239 --> 00:04:56,091
Uh, what do you think
happened here, sir?

72
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,957
I have no idea.

73
00:04:58,041 --> 00:05:00,026
Someone may be playing
a hoax on us.

74
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:02,362
- A hoax?
- Well, yes.

75
00:05:02,446 --> 00:05:04,096
They've staged a scene
so to make it appear

76
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:06,014
that a dead man
committed this crime.

77
00:05:06,817 --> 00:05:08,735
Let's proceed as though
no one has risen

78
00:05:08,819 --> 00:05:10,752
from the dead for now, Henry.

79
00:05:11,288 --> 00:05:12,687
Very good, sir.

80
00:05:16,192 --> 00:05:18,760
Thankfully, both men
were without family.

81
00:05:21,231 --> 00:05:23,827
I spoke to one of the other
groundskeepers, sir.

82
00:05:23,912 --> 00:05:26,886
Uh, one of the dead men, lowell
vaz, worked here for six years.

83
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:28,821
The other, Ronan Trent,

84
00:05:28,905 --> 00:05:31,123
took his dog for his daily walk
here every day.

85
00:05:31,207 --> 00:05:33,326
Oh. Any sign of the dog?

86
00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:35,628
No, sir.
Ah, three-legged

87
00:05:35,712 --> 00:05:37,379
homely creature, I'm told.

88
00:05:37,814 --> 00:05:39,213
Very good, Henry.

89
00:05:39,413 --> 00:05:40,670
Sir. If I may?

90
00:05:40,884 --> 00:05:42,118
Of course.

91
00:05:42,555 --> 00:05:44,572
What do you think about
what George did?

92
00:05:44,954 --> 00:05:46,188
Uh...

93
00:05:46,795 --> 00:05:50,825
I think George left the woman
he loves at the altar.

94
00:05:52,104 --> 00:05:53,255
Yes. And?

95
00:05:53,475 --> 00:05:56,149
All of the years that
I have been doing this, Henry,

96
00:05:56,467 --> 00:06:00,152
I still don't know the
inner workings of man's mind,

97
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:03,015
much less George crabtree's.

98
00:06:03,473 --> 00:06:05,358
I think he got cold feet.

99
00:06:05,614 --> 00:06:08,582
Staged the whole thing
so he wouldn't have to marry.

100
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:12,291
Where might we find
this groundskeeper?

101
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:14,390
This way, sir.

102
00:06:22,125 --> 00:06:25,845
I can't... apologize
for speaking the truth

103
00:06:25,929 --> 00:06:28,296
to spare a life.

104
00:06:28,999 --> 00:06:30,916
Are you sure
this was her fate?

105
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,253
If miss new some were
to marry you, yes!

106
00:06:34,338 --> 00:06:35,338
Why?

107
00:06:35,498 --> 00:06:37,726
(Laughing)

108
00:06:38,008 --> 00:06:40,373
I do not know
the answer to that.

109
00:06:40,458 --> 00:06:44,256
I only know... what is to be.

110
00:06:44,389 --> 00:06:46,866
Your aunt has never
been wrong, George.

111
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:48,000
You know that.

112
00:06:48,084 --> 00:06:49,769
But why not tell me earlier,

113
00:06:49,853 --> 00:06:51,070
when we came for a visit?

114
00:06:51,154 --> 00:06:54,040
The vision had yet
to come to me!

115
00:06:54,124 --> 00:06:56,858
Be thankful it came
to me when it did.

116
00:06:56,943 --> 00:07:00,428
If it had not come, your bride
would be a dead woman!

117
00:07:00,597 --> 00:07:02,698
And your heart would be broken.

118
00:07:03,544 --> 00:07:04,795
My heart is broken.

119
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:08,006
Then go away from here
and let it heal.

120
00:07:09,305 --> 00:07:12,389
Oh, you always were
a sensitive cabbage, George.

121
00:07:12,575 --> 00:07:16,139
But I know you have
a spine of steel.

122
00:07:16,224 --> 00:07:17,557
You will persevere.

123
00:07:25,606 --> 00:07:26,757
(Door closing)

124
00:07:26,919 --> 00:07:29,018
It's not even
consecrated land.

125
00:07:29,225 --> 00:07:31,043
Shouldn't have been anyone
buried over there.

126
00:07:31,295 --> 00:07:32,812
Well, it seems there was.

127
00:07:33,029 --> 00:07:35,163
Still, no record of it.

128
00:07:35,948 --> 00:07:38,913
Do you have a list of the
recent arrivals to this place?

129
00:07:39,068 --> 00:07:41,120
- That I do.
- And you can provide it?

130
00:07:41,337 --> 00:07:42,387
Of course.

131
00:07:42,584 --> 00:07:44,590
But where those two men

132
00:07:44,674 --> 00:07:47,375
were found, it wasn't no plot.

133
00:07:49,412 --> 00:07:50,596
I see.

134
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:53,247
Well, it seems to have served
the same purpose.

135
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:55,650
You know what I think?

136
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:58,045
It was a hole
the devil got out of.

137
00:08:01,958 --> 00:08:03,891
(Baby cooing)

138
00:08:19,508 --> 00:08:22,160
I don't think
Mr. Frank Lloyd Wright

139
00:08:22,245 --> 00:08:24,430
would approve of what we've done
with his home.

140
00:08:24,514 --> 00:08:26,581
It's our home.

141
00:08:26,965 --> 00:08:29,131
I don't know if he'd
see it that way.

142
00:08:30,787 --> 00:08:32,839
What's caught your attention?

143
00:08:32,923 --> 00:08:36,424
It's a list of recent arrivals
to pauper's field.

144
00:08:36,655 --> 00:08:38,311
And why is that?

145
00:08:38,741 --> 00:08:41,047
Well, if I'm to believe
the evidence before me,

146
00:08:41,217 --> 00:08:44,600
one of them has risen from
the dead and killed two men.

147
00:08:44,694 --> 00:08:47,119
I take it you don't
believe that.

148
00:08:47,311 --> 00:08:50,338
I'm not George Crab Tree,
Julia.

149
00:08:51,094 --> 00:08:52,512
Have you spoken with him?

150
00:08:52,756 --> 00:08:53,842
A little.

151
00:08:53,928 --> 00:08:55,995
And why did he walk out
on his wedding?

152
00:08:56,079 --> 00:08:58,467
Apparently,
one of his aunts warned him

153
00:08:58,552 --> 00:09:03,163
that if he were to marry, his
bride would be doomed to die.

154
00:09:04,054 --> 00:09:06,303
I hope you talked
sense to him?

155
00:09:06,388 --> 00:09:10,357
It's George, Julia. Sometimes,
common sense doesn't work.

156
00:09:11,227 --> 00:09:13,145
And what are we doing with that?

157
00:09:13,229 --> 00:09:15,997
Oh. Doctor grace's gift.

158
00:09:16,311 --> 00:09:17,944
It's hideous.

159
00:09:18,902 --> 00:09:20,095
It is that.

160
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:22,213
Not to mention impractical.

161
00:09:22,726 --> 00:09:24,327
Also that.

162
00:09:25,375 --> 00:09:26,826
Can we burn it?

163
00:09:27,724 --> 00:09:30,937
(Both Laughing)

164
00:09:31,358 --> 00:09:33,617
(Indistinct chatter)

165
00:09:37,754 --> 00:09:39,954
(Indistinct chatter)

166
00:09:49,366 --> 00:09:52,967
All right, if anybody has
anything to say, say it now.

167
00:09:53,209 --> 00:09:55,475
(Mumbling)
(Clearing throat)

168
00:09:55,939 --> 00:09:56,937
Where's Watts?

169
00:09:57,022 --> 00:09:57,999
He left.

170
00:09:58,084 --> 00:09:59,592
Left for where?

171
00:09:59,676 --> 00:10:02,243
He didn't say
and no one saw him go.

172
00:10:02,722 --> 00:10:03,972
What are you doing?

173
00:10:04,334 --> 00:10:06,665
I'm assisting the detective
with a murder investigation.

174
00:10:06,749 --> 00:10:08,301
The killer came from
beyond the grave.

175
00:10:08,385 --> 00:10:10,135
It's right up your alley.
- I'm sure you'll do fine.

176
00:10:10,219 --> 00:10:12,123
- George!
- Oh, for Pete's sake.

177
00:10:12,208 --> 00:10:14,921
What are you doing here?
- I was rather blunt earlier.

178
00:10:15,006 --> 00:10:19,712
I came to apologize. Not for
my prediction, but for my manner.

179
00:10:19,796 --> 00:10:21,530
Are you here
on police business?

180
00:10:21,615 --> 00:10:23,400
I'm here to see my nephew.

181
00:10:23,485 --> 00:10:24,736
Well, see him
on your own time.

182
00:10:24,821 --> 00:10:26,205
We're working here.
- Sir!

183
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:27,317
I'm asking her to leave.

184
00:10:27,402 --> 00:10:28,899
Do you have an issue
with that, Crab Tree?

185
00:10:28,983 --> 00:10:30,538
Don't worry, George.

186
00:10:30,974 --> 00:10:32,407
I'm leaving.

187
00:10:34,844 --> 00:10:36,362
You need to get
your house in order.

188
00:10:36,446 --> 00:10:38,130
Sir, she's just trying
to protect me.

189
00:10:38,214 --> 00:10:40,032
I don't understand you,
Crab Tree.

190
00:10:40,116 --> 00:10:41,900
You've been working
for the last 15 years

191
00:10:41,984 --> 00:10:44,637
with the most logical,
intelligent man I've ever known,

192
00:10:44,721 --> 00:10:47,373
yet you still believe
all this mumbo jumbo claptrap

193
00:10:47,457 --> 00:10:48,334
that you get fed!

194
00:10:48,419 --> 00:10:50,519
Sir, my aunt has
never been wrong!

195
00:10:50,894 --> 00:10:52,128
(Sighing)

196
00:10:55,165 --> 00:10:56,515
It's all right, George.

197
00:10:56,599 --> 00:10:57,783
I understand.

198
00:10:57,867 --> 00:10:59,452
- You do?
- Yes!

199
00:10:59,536 --> 00:11:00,753
You're a lucky man.

200
00:11:00,837 --> 00:11:02,321
Lucky? How so?

201
00:11:02,405 --> 00:11:04,857
You never actually wanted
to marry miss new some,

202
00:11:04,941 --> 00:11:07,093
but you were too afraid
to ever say that,

203
00:11:07,177 --> 00:11:10,062
so when your aunt walked in,
you had the perfect excuse.

204
00:11:10,146 --> 00:11:11,530
Almost as if you planned it.

205
00:11:11,614 --> 00:11:13,065
Higgins, watch what
you're saying!

206
00:11:13,149 --> 00:11:14,200
George, it's all right.

207
00:11:14,284 --> 00:11:16,518
There's no shame...
- I'm serious. Shut your mouth!

208
00:11:16,886 --> 00:11:17,936
(Grunting)

209
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:19,204
Pack it in, the pair o' ya.

210
00:11:19,288 --> 00:11:20,272
Crabtree, get out of here.

211
00:11:20,356 --> 00:11:21,574
Sir! He's trying
to insinuate...

212
00:11:21,658 --> 00:11:23,542
I don't give a toss what
Higgins is trying to say.

213
00:11:23,626 --> 00:11:24,626
Go home!

214
00:11:24,733 --> 00:11:26,100
Not a word!

215
00:11:28,698 --> 00:11:30,383
Inspector Thomas brackenreid?

216
00:11:30,467 --> 00:11:32,117
Who are you?
What do you want?

217
00:11:32,201 --> 00:11:33,886
Raymond felding,
private investigator.

218
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:36,155
A moment of your time?
- I'm busy.

219
00:11:36,239 --> 00:11:38,079
Uh, it's a matter
that concerns the both of us.

220
00:11:38,172 --> 00:11:39,926
It's about a man
named llewellyn Watts.

221
00:11:41,244 --> 00:11:42,478
Follow me.

222
00:11:48,785 --> 00:11:50,102
This is about Watts?

223
00:11:50,186 --> 00:11:51,570
Yeah, I'm looking for him.

224
00:11:51,654 --> 00:11:53,888
- You and me both.
- I see.

225
00:11:54,414 --> 00:11:55,614
What's your business with him?

226
00:11:55,725 --> 00:11:57,592
Ah, it's a personal matter.

227
00:11:58,862 --> 00:12:00,179
Whether Watts is here or not,

228
00:12:00,263 --> 00:12:02,715
he's still in the employ
of the Toronto constabulary.

229
00:12:02,799 --> 00:12:05,651
So, I'll ask you again:
What's your business with him?

230
00:12:05,735 --> 00:12:08,721
I am hoping he can help me
locate a Mr. Jack Walker.

231
00:12:08,805 --> 00:12:10,803
How can Watts
help you with this?

232
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:14,460
I believe they are of a...
Close acquaintance.

233
00:12:14,544 --> 00:12:16,311
I don't know anything
about that.

234
00:12:16,803 --> 00:12:17,797
I see.

235
00:12:17,881 --> 00:12:19,665
And what do you want
with Mr. Walker?

236
00:12:19,749 --> 00:12:22,280
Well, he's abducted a child.

237
00:12:22,452 --> 00:12:25,204
I'm trying to return this child
to his maternal grandparents.

238
00:12:25,288 --> 00:12:27,354
I don't know anything
about that, either.

239
00:12:28,491 --> 00:12:31,877
This child is being raised
in an obscene environment

240
00:12:31,961 --> 00:12:34,028
by an immoral man.

241
00:12:34,364 --> 00:12:35,715
It's your duty.

242
00:12:35,799 --> 00:12:41,002
Mr. Felding, you don't
tell me what my duty is.

243
00:12:42,572 --> 00:12:44,623
You know, I've been given
a substantial sum

244
00:12:44,707 --> 00:12:46,341
to locate this child.

245
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:51,296
I'm not shy about offering
a share if someone can help me.

246
00:12:51,381 --> 00:12:54,467
If you're finished attempting
to bribe a police officer,

247
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:57,774
I suggest you take your leave,
Mr. Felding.

248
00:12:57,914 --> 00:13:00,694
Otherwise, I'll have you
escorted out.

249
00:13:03,993 --> 00:13:05,227
Good day.

250
00:13:18,474 --> 00:13:21,530
(♪)

251
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:28,116
Sir!

252
00:13:28,201 --> 00:13:29,281
What have you, Henry?

253
00:13:29,366 --> 00:13:31,022
I've contacted
the records office.

254
00:13:31,107 --> 00:13:33,338
They're assembling files
on all recent hospital deaths.

255
00:13:33,423 --> 00:13:35,022
Very good. Thank you.

256
00:13:39,062 --> 00:13:40,296
Julia!

257
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:41,680
Is everything all right?

258
00:13:41,764 --> 00:13:43,348
Yes! Everything's
perfectly fine.

259
00:13:43,432 --> 00:13:44,683
Perhaps too much so.

260
00:13:44,767 --> 00:13:46,351
Ah, look who's here.

261
00:13:46,435 --> 00:13:47,953
Is she reading and writing yet?

262
00:13:48,037 --> 00:13:51,590
Actually, William has her
working on her maths right now.

263
00:13:51,674 --> 00:13:52,958
That's a joke, right?

264
00:13:53,042 --> 00:13:54,760
I wish it were.

265
00:13:54,844 --> 00:13:56,295
It's important!

266
00:13:56,379 --> 00:13:59,331
William, I'm thinking
of returning to the clinic.

267
00:13:59,415 --> 00:14:01,967
- Uh, Julia.
- Not every day.

268
00:14:02,051 --> 00:14:05,838
But Ellie is taking such
excellent care of susannah and...

269
00:14:05,922 --> 00:14:07,506
Yes, well, for what
we're paying her.

270
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:09,241
Did I hear
the clinic mentioned?

271
00:14:09,325 --> 00:14:10,709
Could Margaret join you?

272
00:14:10,793 --> 00:14:12,244
I know she valued
her time there.

273
00:14:12,328 --> 00:14:13,961
Well, yes. Of course.

274
00:14:16,098 --> 00:14:17,716
If you think it's best.

275
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:21,153
- And where are you off to?
- Ah. Hospital records office.

276
00:14:21,237 --> 00:14:23,055
I'm looking into
the circumstances

277
00:14:23,139 --> 00:14:24,990
behind all of their
latest deaths.

278
00:14:25,074 --> 00:14:27,993
Your husband is looking for
a member of the walking dead.

279
00:14:28,077 --> 00:14:30,296
Ah! Perhaps he should start
at the Mason's lodge.

280
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:32,146
(Laughing)

281
00:14:33,182 --> 00:14:34,466
Do you mind if I join you?

282
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:36,268
It would be nice
to have a moment alone.

283
00:14:36,352 --> 00:14:37,536
Of course.

284
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:42,007
Ah, sir, any news on Watts'
whereabouts yet?

285
00:14:42,091 --> 00:14:43,490
Not as of yet.

286
00:14:44,022 --> 00:14:45,878
Do you have any idea
if he plans to return?

287
00:14:45,962 --> 00:14:46,979
I don't know.

288
00:14:47,063 --> 00:14:49,464
He appears to have vanished
into thin air.

289
00:14:49,933 --> 00:14:51,199
Carry on.

290
00:14:52,835 --> 00:14:54,153
(Indistinct chatter)

291
00:14:54,237 --> 00:14:55,821
Oh! Excellent!

292
00:14:55,905 --> 00:14:57,890
These are much better
than the ones in Canada.

293
00:14:57,974 --> 00:14:59,925
Hey, of course they are!
This is New York City.

294
00:15:00,009 --> 00:15:02,777
Everything's better here.
- Mm. Would you like some?

295
00:15:03,412 --> 00:15:05,831
Hello. How you doing, buddy?

296
00:15:05,915 --> 00:15:07,967
- Ah. All finished for the day?
- Yes, indeed.

297
00:15:08,051 --> 00:15:09,501
I'm all yours. Good lord!

298
00:15:09,585 --> 00:15:11,503
How many of those are you
going to eat in a day?

299
00:15:11,587 --> 00:15:13,172
I don't count.
I simply consume.

300
00:15:13,256 --> 00:15:15,574
Oh! I see him
at least three times.

301
00:15:15,658 --> 00:15:17,376
Oh, we'll have
to put a stop to that.

302
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:19,741
No, no, no, no!
Please don't. Please don't.

303
00:15:19,826 --> 00:15:21,288
So, have you given any thought

304
00:15:21,373 --> 00:15:22,946
as to what you're going to do
now that you're here?

305
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:25,054
Have you ever heard
the term "franchise"?

306
00:15:25,139 --> 00:15:26,719
- I have.
- Well, I've been talking

307
00:15:26,804 --> 00:15:29,838
to Abraham. Perhaps I'll get
into the bagel business.

308
00:15:29,923 --> 00:15:31,689
- Yes?
- Yes.

309
00:15:31,876 --> 00:15:33,126
Not serious.

310
00:15:33,406 --> 00:15:35,640
Right now I'm simply
happy being here.

311
00:15:36,532 --> 00:15:37,766
All right.

312
00:15:43,619 --> 00:15:45,137
So there's no living person

313
00:15:45,221 --> 00:15:47,005
who wished either
of the victims ill?

314
00:15:47,089 --> 00:15:48,923
None that I can find.

315
00:15:49,325 --> 00:15:50,891
Are you sure?

316
00:15:51,303 --> 00:15:54,566
You said there was no record of
anyone being interred there.

317
00:15:54,651 --> 00:15:58,030
Perhaps the disturbed
grave was... a hoax?

318
00:15:58,506 --> 00:16:01,287
So, it's your theory
that a live person

319
00:16:01,371 --> 00:16:05,873
staged this murder and then
assigned the blame to a Haitian zombie?

320
00:16:07,310 --> 00:16:08,772
Who would believe that?

321
00:16:08,978 --> 00:16:12,334
I can think of one constable
at your station that might.

322
00:16:12,699 --> 00:16:14,725
Still, I don't think
it's likely.

323
00:16:15,485 --> 00:16:17,577
You need to talk
to him, William.

324
00:16:17,905 --> 00:16:19,905
While he still has
a chance with effie.

325
00:16:19,989 --> 00:16:22,841
If George wants to discuss it
with me, he will.

326
00:16:22,925 --> 00:16:24,827
Well, you need
to press him on it.

327
00:16:24,998 --> 00:16:27,155
Julia, I am just
not comfortable

328
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,858
with those sorts
of conversations.

329
00:16:28,966 --> 00:16:30,782
Well, you need
to get comfortable.

330
00:16:30,867 --> 00:16:32,367
You have a daughter now!

331
00:16:32,817 --> 00:16:35,486
Things that are not pleasant
or easy to talk about

332
00:16:35,571 --> 00:16:38,272
are going to need to be
discussed at some point.

333
00:16:39,058 --> 00:16:40,209
I know.

334
00:16:40,294 --> 00:16:42,161
That's why I have you.

335
00:16:45,614 --> 00:16:48,667
Well, all of the deaths
from St. Michael's

336
00:16:48,751 --> 00:16:50,251
are accounted for.

337
00:16:51,554 --> 00:16:52,853
(Sighing)

338
00:16:53,383 --> 00:16:55,592
I do hope susannah
has the sense

339
00:16:55,691 --> 00:16:57,944
to not follow us
in our footsteps.

340
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:00,194
What would you
have her do instead?

341
00:17:01,397 --> 00:17:03,130
Something exciting.

342
00:17:03,853 --> 00:17:05,459
A politician, perhaps?

343
00:17:05,638 --> 00:17:07,438
An aviator?

344
00:17:07,691 --> 00:17:10,859
I just want her to live her
life not surrounded by death.

345
00:17:13,943 --> 00:17:15,694
And you should talk to George!

346
00:17:16,066 --> 00:17:17,565
(Sighing)

347
00:17:27,256 --> 00:17:29,408
Well, I read
in women's monthly

348
00:17:29,492 --> 00:17:30,937
that when you've suffered
heartbreak,

349
00:17:31,022 --> 00:17:32,755
you should wear
bright colours.

350
00:17:35,731 --> 00:17:37,361
That's exciting.

351
00:17:37,446 --> 00:17:39,046
So we should go shopping.

352
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:43,722
Effie, I have to talk to you.

353
00:17:43,806 --> 00:17:45,413
Well, she doesn't want
to talk to you.

354
00:17:45,498 --> 00:17:46,658
Well, I'm not talking to you.

355
00:17:46,742 --> 00:17:48,160
I have nothing to say
to you, George.

356
00:17:48,244 --> 00:17:49,998
Well, I have something
to say to you:

357
00:17:50,177 --> 00:17:51,595
I had to do what I did.

358
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,483
Well, you did it,
so good for you.

359
00:17:53,568 --> 00:17:54,852
I did it to save your life.

360
00:17:54,937 --> 00:17:56,488
George. Grow up.

361
00:17:56,619 --> 00:17:59,992
My aunt oleander told me that
if I marry you, you would die.

362
00:18:00,077 --> 00:18:03,476
I heard the same thing
you did and it's poppycock.

363
00:18:03,561 --> 00:18:05,177
It's ridiculous.
- It's not.

364
00:18:05,261 --> 00:18:06,773
If you didn't want
to marry her,

365
00:18:06,858 --> 00:18:07,914
you could have just said so.

366
00:18:07,998 --> 00:18:09,318
Millie, this is none
of your business.

367
00:18:09,403 --> 00:18:10,782
It is! She's my friend.

368
00:18:10,867 --> 00:18:12,751
- I love her!
- You love me?

369
00:18:12,835 --> 00:18:14,453
You love me? Really?

370
00:18:14,537 --> 00:18:16,021
Is that why you humiliated me

371
00:18:16,105 --> 00:18:17,561
in front of my friends
and my family?

372
00:18:17,646 --> 00:18:18,596
I'm sorry.

373
00:18:18,681 --> 00:18:20,399
That's not good enough,
George.

374
00:18:20,764 --> 00:18:23,028
Just leave me alone, would you?

375
00:18:23,233 --> 00:18:25,655
Just go back to your spooks
and your spirits.

376
00:18:25,756 --> 00:18:27,381
I am too good to be
with a simpleton.

377
00:18:27,466 --> 00:18:29,967
- Effie.
- Just leave me, would you?

378
00:18:30,052 --> 00:18:33,623
If you had any decency,
you would just leave me alone.

379
00:18:35,395 --> 00:18:36,629
(Grunts)

380
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:41,864
Effie.

381
00:18:47,003 --> 00:18:48,769
(Crying)

382
00:18:52,545 --> 00:18:53,779
Miss Cherry?

383
00:18:54,877 --> 00:18:56,361
Detective Murdoch.

384
00:18:56,445 --> 00:18:58,330
Is there something
I can help you with?

385
00:18:58,585 --> 00:19:00,551
How is George faring?

386
00:19:00,803 --> 00:19:03,068
But that's hardly a matter
for public consumption.

387
00:19:03,152 --> 00:19:04,265
I wasn't going
to write about it.

388
00:19:04,349 --> 00:19:06,959
I'm simply concerned.
- Oh. My apologies.

389
00:19:07,122 --> 00:19:10,876
But... there is another matter
I'm concerned about.

390
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,544
Of course there is.

391
00:19:12,628 --> 00:19:14,929
What can you tell me about
the zombie killer?

392
00:19:15,764 --> 00:19:16,998
Nothing.

393
00:19:17,584 --> 00:19:20,476
There have been reports
that a hideous creature

394
00:19:20,561 --> 00:19:22,955
has arisen from the grave
and is attacking Toronto.

395
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:25,957
Can I say,
"that's ridiculous!"

396
00:19:26,041 --> 00:19:27,326
I've been robbed.

397
00:19:27,410 --> 00:19:29,428
Excuse me a moment,
miss Cherry.

398
00:19:29,512 --> 00:19:31,329
What's happened?
- A man broke into my shop.

399
00:19:31,413 --> 00:19:33,465
I was there.
- Did he hurt you?

400
00:19:33,549 --> 00:19:35,534
Just scared
the daylights out of me.

401
00:19:35,618 --> 00:19:38,270
He stole two guns,
some ammunition.

402
00:19:38,354 --> 00:19:40,906
- And when did this happen?
- Only an hour ago.

403
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:44,025
- Well, can you describe him?
- He was a big fellow.

404
00:19:44,448 --> 00:19:45,699
Anything else?

405
00:19:45,784 --> 00:19:48,296
He was covered
in dirt and soil.

406
00:19:48,381 --> 00:19:50,364
- I beg your pardon?
- You didn't hear me?

407
00:19:50,449 --> 00:19:52,850
He was covered in earth.

408
00:19:53,035 --> 00:19:54,786
Dirt. And he had a dog.

409
00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:58,105
A crazy-looking thing
with three legs.

410
00:19:59,648 --> 00:20:02,858
The constable will take the
remainder of your statement.

411
00:20:04,656 --> 00:20:07,091
The three-legged dog
is a nice twist.

412
00:20:12,254 --> 00:20:14,788
(Singing)

413
00:20:22,865 --> 00:20:28,046
♪ Good morning
merry sunshine ♪

414
00:20:28,130 --> 00:20:33,614
♪ How did you wake so soon ♪

415
00:20:33,702 --> 00:20:39,258
♪ You've scared
the little birds awake ♪

416
00:20:39,382 --> 00:20:43,984
♪ And shined away the moon ♪

417
00:20:44,539 --> 00:20:46,490
(Humming)

418
00:20:46,722 --> 00:20:47,956
(Door closing)

419
00:20:49,328 --> 00:20:50,562
George!

420
00:20:52,546 --> 00:20:53,846
May I join you?

421
00:20:56,699 --> 00:20:59,718
George, what I said
was inappropriate.

422
00:20:59,802 --> 00:21:02,921
- It was incorrect.
- All right.

423
00:21:03,005 --> 00:21:04,738
It was incorrect, as well.

424
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:06,364
(Applause)

425
00:21:06,542 --> 00:21:09,127
My aunt oleander's never wrong
about these things, Henry.

426
00:21:09,211 --> 00:21:12,431
I can't explain. She...
She has some sort of gift.

427
00:21:12,515 --> 00:21:16,101
Even as a child, I remember
once she begged my uncle

428
00:21:16,185 --> 00:21:18,337
not to go out to sea.
This is back in new found land.

429
00:21:18,421 --> 00:21:21,722
And he didn't listen to her
and he never returned.

430
00:21:22,475 --> 00:21:24,710
He drowned in
the Atlantic ocean, George.

431
00:21:24,794 --> 00:21:26,078
It's hardly unusual.

432
00:21:26,162 --> 00:21:27,779
Yes, but that's one
of many things

433
00:21:27,863 --> 00:21:30,148
that she foretold
and it came true.

434
00:21:30,232 --> 00:21:32,017
I can't expect you
to understand, Higgins,

435
00:21:32,101 --> 00:21:33,819
but I can't risk effie's life.

436
00:21:33,903 --> 00:21:36,264
Constables, I wonder
if you can help?

437
00:21:36,349 --> 00:21:37,723
Uh, currently off
the clock, ma'am.

438
00:21:37,807 --> 00:21:39,391
Sorry.
- Higgins!

439
00:21:39,475 --> 00:21:40,741
What is it, miss bright?

440
00:21:40,827 --> 00:21:42,861
Someone broke into
my establishment last night,

441
00:21:42,945 --> 00:21:44,496
stole three bottles of whisky.

442
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:46,498
- Did you report it?
- Certainly did.

443
00:21:46,582 --> 00:21:49,515
I told the officer on patrol.
He did nothing.

444
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,970
Well, unfortunately,
with that kind of thing,

445
00:21:52,054 --> 00:21:53,705
unless we catch
somebody in the act,

446
00:21:53,789 --> 00:21:54,973
there's little we can do.

447
00:21:55,057 --> 00:21:57,075
Hardly a surprise.

448
00:21:57,159 --> 00:21:58,877
Sorry we can't be more help.

449
00:21:58,961 --> 00:22:00,494
Yes, well...

450
00:22:01,530 --> 00:22:04,182
If all I heard is true,
after the last couple of days,

451
00:22:04,266 --> 00:22:06,233
you deserve to have
a free drink.

452
00:22:06,535 --> 00:22:07,641
On the house.

453
00:22:07,726 --> 00:22:09,192
Not for you, though.

454
00:22:10,224 --> 00:22:12,175
Good lord!
Does the whole world know?

455
00:22:12,408 --> 00:22:15,776
George, I just want you
to think about this.

456
00:22:17,213 --> 00:22:19,397
You and effie visited
your aunts, did you not?

457
00:22:19,481 --> 00:22:20,532
We did.

458
00:22:20,616 --> 00:22:21,867
And they said nothing
about this

459
00:22:21,951 --> 00:22:23,302
while you were visiting them?

460
00:22:23,386 --> 00:22:25,904
No. But they didn't know
we were to be married.

461
00:22:25,988 --> 00:22:28,740
My aunt chrysanthemum
found out only days before.

462
00:22:28,824 --> 00:22:31,643
So, armed with
this information,

463
00:22:31,727 --> 00:22:33,912
they rushed into Toronto
to break up the wedding?

464
00:22:33,996 --> 00:22:35,547
That doesn't seem
suspicious to you?

465
00:22:35,631 --> 00:22:37,482
I think they were trying
to save effie's life.

466
00:22:37,566 --> 00:22:38,817
Perhaps.

467
00:22:38,901 --> 00:22:41,402
But what if there was
another motive?

468
00:22:41,542 --> 00:22:43,054
It's not as though your aunts

469
00:22:43,139 --> 00:22:45,406
have followed the straight
and narrow path.

470
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:53,565
George wants to speak to me.

471
00:22:53,649 --> 00:22:56,034
- He has questions?
- I suppose.

472
00:22:56,118 --> 00:22:58,503
Hm. Then we must give him
no reason to doubt

473
00:22:58,587 --> 00:23:01,088
the accuracy
of your predictions.

474
00:23:02,124 --> 00:23:03,508
Thanks for coming to see me.

475
00:23:03,592 --> 00:23:06,693
Again, I apologize
for the news I had to deliver.

476
00:23:07,459 --> 00:23:10,111
Can I ask why you came
all the way here to do so?

477
00:23:10,196 --> 00:23:11,847
I wanted to tell you
in person.

478
00:23:11,932 --> 00:23:14,299
I did not think a telegram
would suffice.

479
00:23:14,910 --> 00:23:16,655
How did you even know
I was to be married?

480
00:23:16,739 --> 00:23:18,123
Chrysanthemum told me.

481
00:23:18,207 --> 00:23:21,393
And, once I heard,
I knew I had to stop it.

482
00:23:21,477 --> 00:23:22,611
Oh.

483
00:23:22,695 --> 00:23:24,296
So, my upcoming marriage
didn't, uh,

484
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:25,864
come to you in a vision?

485
00:23:25,948 --> 00:23:28,867
No, it did not come
to me in a vision, George!

486
00:23:28,951 --> 00:23:30,736
And you know better
than to mock me!

487
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:34,254
Well, maybe I wouldn't if you
hadn't stolen my happiness.

488
00:23:35,023 --> 00:23:37,290
Something that is
not my intention.

489
00:23:39,628 --> 00:23:41,261
See that man there?

490
00:23:41,597 --> 00:23:42,981
In the grey hat.

491
00:23:43,065 --> 00:23:44,531
Yes, why?

492
00:23:45,198 --> 00:23:49,067
Something ill is about
to befall him.

493
00:23:49,939 --> 00:23:51,022
Good lord!

494
00:23:51,106 --> 00:23:53,006
(Screaming)

495
00:23:56,886 --> 00:23:59,097
But... well, he's not dead.

496
00:23:59,181 --> 00:24:00,965
I didn't say he was going
to die, George.

497
00:24:01,049 --> 00:24:04,851
I merely said, "something ill is
about to befall him" and it did.

498
00:24:05,521 --> 00:24:09,434
It is a heavy burden
that I bear

499
00:24:09,519 --> 00:24:12,110
and it pains me
to break your heart,

500
00:24:12,194 --> 00:24:15,947
but, my little cabbage,
I owe you the truth

501
00:24:16,031 --> 00:24:20,234
and a chance for happiness
and not misery.

502
00:24:28,277 --> 00:24:30,061
The Street saw menace, George.

503
00:24:30,145 --> 00:24:32,528
Ruthie nearly gets struck
by a vehicle every second week.

504
00:24:32,613 --> 00:24:34,330
Higgins, I'm telling you:
My aunt said something

505
00:24:34,414 --> 00:24:36,729
would befall this chap and he
was struck a moment later.

506
00:24:36,813 --> 00:24:38,403
Like I said, George,
it's a coincidence.

507
00:24:38,487 --> 00:24:39,504
You're wrong, Henry.

508
00:24:39,588 --> 00:24:41,588
I'm living under
a cloud of doom.

509
00:24:42,291 --> 00:24:44,592
George.
How are you faring?

510
00:24:45,895 --> 00:24:48,480
- I've been better, sir.
- Well, I just happen

511
00:24:48,564 --> 00:24:50,996
to be working on a case
that might interest you.

512
00:24:51,081 --> 00:24:52,231
Uh, with your permission,

513
00:24:52,316 --> 00:24:53,567
I'm sure you and Henry
can handle it.

514
00:24:53,769 --> 00:24:55,003
George.

515
00:24:56,972 --> 00:24:58,457
You've made one mistake.

516
00:24:58,541 --> 00:24:59,624
There could still be time to...

517
00:24:59,708 --> 00:25:01,982
If you don't mind, sir,
I have a patrol to get to.

518
00:25:03,779 --> 00:25:05,079
All right.

519
00:25:06,515 --> 00:25:08,348
(♪)

520
00:25:11,787 --> 00:25:13,954
(Indistinct chatter)

521
00:25:18,627 --> 00:25:20,345
I'm certainly glad
you're here.

522
00:25:20,429 --> 00:25:21,480
Thank you.

523
00:25:21,564 --> 00:25:23,748
Saves on having to pay someone
to look in on him.

524
00:25:23,832 --> 00:25:25,116
Ah! Very funny.

525
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,701
I shall see you when I return.

526
00:25:30,205 --> 00:25:33,306
Well, Samuel,
what do we do today?

527
00:25:35,143 --> 00:25:36,995
And nothing else was stolen?

528
00:25:37,079 --> 00:25:39,431
Just three bottles
of good whisky.

529
00:25:39,515 --> 00:25:41,715
We should get some
new locks for the door.

530
00:25:42,351 --> 00:25:44,236
You do work with the police.

531
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:47,205
Perhaps they could come
around more often.

532
00:25:47,289 --> 00:25:49,474
That may do more harm
than good.

533
00:25:49,558 --> 00:25:52,059
I think we can tend
to ourselves, miss bright.

534
00:25:54,496 --> 00:25:58,165
The books all appear to be
in order, except for this.

535
00:25:59,702 --> 00:26:00,852
Yes.

536
00:26:00,936 --> 00:26:03,488
That is our tribute
to alderman Prescott.

537
00:26:03,572 --> 00:26:05,305
We're paying him now?

538
00:26:05,774 --> 00:26:07,408
Keeps the doors open.

539
00:26:08,444 --> 00:26:10,443
I did tell you, didn't I?

540
00:26:11,213 --> 00:26:12,746
Did tell me what?

541
00:26:13,915 --> 00:26:16,430
That given the chance, I'd
make something of this place.

542
00:26:17,252 --> 00:26:19,686
It's a good thing your father
didn't get a hold of it.

543
00:26:20,923 --> 00:26:23,189
It's a good thing
my father died.

544
00:26:24,393 --> 00:26:26,694
That is not what I intended
to say, Violet.

545
00:26:27,329 --> 00:26:29,062
That's all right, miss bright.

546
00:26:29,598 --> 00:26:31,316
I share a similar sentiment.

547
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,634
Good night.

548
00:26:33,802 --> 00:26:35,302
(Baby cooing)

549
00:26:36,383 --> 00:26:37,498
Jack!

550
00:26:37,583 --> 00:26:39,323
Uh, Jack's out.

551
00:26:39,408 --> 00:26:40,559
Can I help you?

552
00:26:40,643 --> 00:26:42,661
Did you see anyone
near my flat?

553
00:26:42,745 --> 00:26:44,929
- No.
- Are you sure?

554
00:26:45,013 --> 00:26:47,032
You didn't hear anything
out of the ordinary?

555
00:26:47,116 --> 00:26:49,082
I did not. Why?

556
00:26:49,485 --> 00:26:50,884
Look.

557
00:26:52,087 --> 00:26:53,654
One moment.

558
00:26:57,559 --> 00:27:00,393
- I've been robbed.
- I can see that.

559
00:27:01,897 --> 00:27:03,481
What am I supposed to do?

560
00:27:03,565 --> 00:27:06,384
Everything that I own
is in this room.

561
00:27:06,468 --> 00:27:07,819
Let me take a look.

562
00:27:07,903 --> 00:27:10,203
I have some experience
in these matters.

563
00:27:12,841 --> 00:27:14,075
(Sighing)

564
00:27:15,043 --> 00:27:18,311
Let's go see what we can do.

565
00:27:19,348 --> 00:27:21,366
They took my father's coins.

566
00:27:21,450 --> 00:27:23,751
- Were they hidden?
- Yes.

567
00:27:24,027 --> 00:27:25,560
So, the thief knew of them?

568
00:27:26,521 --> 00:27:27,539
I suppose.

569
00:27:27,623 --> 00:27:29,440
So, it would follow,
you know the thief,

570
00:27:29,524 --> 00:27:32,177
or the thief knows you.
- I don't know who it is.

571
00:27:32,261 --> 00:27:37,115
I understand that, but it does
give us a list of suspects.

572
00:27:37,199 --> 00:27:39,017
Who of the people you know

573
00:27:39,101 --> 00:27:41,386
would know that this coin
collection was valuable?

574
00:27:41,470 --> 00:27:43,288
I suppose everyone.

575
00:27:43,372 --> 00:27:44,889
I did crow about it a bit.

576
00:27:44,973 --> 00:27:46,272
Hm. Trevor.

577
00:27:46,875 --> 00:27:48,032
What happened?

578
00:27:48,244 --> 00:27:49,454
Are... you all right?

579
00:27:49,539 --> 00:27:50,762
Does it look like it?

580
00:27:50,846 --> 00:27:52,330
Have the police been informed?

581
00:27:52,414 --> 00:27:54,032
- No.
- Well, we should...

582
00:27:54,116 --> 00:27:55,350
No.

583
00:27:55,612 --> 00:27:58,926
We don't bother the police
and they don't bother us.

584
00:27:59,154 --> 00:28:00,572
That is the way it works here.

585
00:28:00,656 --> 00:28:02,522
He's right, llewellyn.

586
00:28:03,225 --> 00:28:06,326
I see.
So, we solve it ourselves?

587
00:28:10,699 --> 00:28:12,050
What's this then?

588
00:28:12,134 --> 00:28:14,919
It's a list of the deceased in
Toronto over the past two weeks.

589
00:28:15,003 --> 00:28:17,070
- You're missing one.
- I am?

590
00:28:17,439 --> 00:28:19,639
Maurice majors.

591
00:28:20,075 --> 00:28:21,875
Violet hart's father.

592
00:28:24,012 --> 00:28:25,845
Watts thinks I killed him.

593
00:28:26,269 --> 00:28:27,983
That's part of the reason
why he left.

594
00:28:29,718 --> 00:28:30,735
Did you?

595
00:28:30,819 --> 00:28:32,852
Don't be a prat, Higgins.

596
00:28:33,421 --> 00:28:35,640
You should come back
to Wexford.

597
00:28:35,858 --> 00:28:38,043
Roderick still does
carry a torch.

598
00:28:38,127 --> 00:28:40,111
And I hope he lights himself
on fire with it.

599
00:28:40,195 --> 00:28:43,030
(Laughing)
My life is here, Millie.

600
00:28:45,134 --> 00:28:46,368
There!

601
00:28:46,953 --> 00:28:49,348
It's that witch that
destroyed your life!

602
00:28:49,433 --> 00:28:50,699
- Millie.
- You!

603
00:28:50,784 --> 00:28:51,848
No!

604
00:28:51,933 --> 00:28:53,592
You should be ashamed
of yourself!

605
00:28:53,677 --> 00:28:54,827
Showing your face in public!

606
00:28:54,912 --> 00:28:55,941
You're the maid!

607
00:28:56,026 --> 00:28:58,829
The maid of hon our
at a wedding you destroyed.

608
00:28:58,914 --> 00:28:59,931
Oh.

609
00:29:00,015 --> 00:29:02,333
I know your heart
is filled with grief.

610
00:29:02,417 --> 00:29:03,635
It's more like anger.

611
00:29:03,719 --> 00:29:05,437
I was only trying
to save the two of you.

612
00:29:05,521 --> 00:29:07,004
Well, I think you are crazy.

613
00:29:07,088 --> 00:29:08,807
And wrong. And George?

614
00:29:08,891 --> 00:29:11,142
You've filled his head with...
- With the truth!

615
00:29:11,226 --> 00:29:12,944
- Oh! This is ridiculous!
- Millie!

616
00:29:13,028 --> 00:29:14,612
This is George crabtree's fault.

617
00:29:14,696 --> 00:29:18,717
It is no one's fault! No one
except the stars and destiny.

618
00:29:18,801 --> 00:29:20,685
Toronto constabulary!
Move, please!

619
00:29:20,769 --> 00:29:22,387
- Let me pass.
- Why don't you curse me?

620
00:29:22,471 --> 00:29:24,723
- Millie, that's enough!
- What's going on here?

621
00:29:24,807 --> 00:29:26,491
Oh, it's all right, George.

622
00:29:26,575 --> 00:29:28,893
We were... we were just having
a conversation.

623
00:29:28,977 --> 00:29:30,811
We were just on our way
as well.

624
00:29:33,182 --> 00:29:34,481
Mm.

625
00:29:38,053 --> 00:29:39,137
(Sighing)

626
00:29:39,221 --> 00:29:40,438
(Door closing)
(Gasps)

627
00:29:40,522 --> 00:29:41,706
Detective!

628
00:29:41,790 --> 00:29:43,675
I was just about to leave.

629
00:29:43,759 --> 00:29:44,976
How can I help you?

630
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:47,445
I understand your father
passed away recently.

631
00:29:47,529 --> 00:29:49,897
My condolences.
- Thank you.

632
00:29:50,532 --> 00:29:53,050
If I may, what killed him?

633
00:29:53,134 --> 00:29:54,919
He had a brain embolism.

634
00:29:55,003 --> 00:29:56,669
Very unexpected.

635
00:29:57,472 --> 00:29:59,306
Where was he buried?

636
00:29:59,975 --> 00:30:01,741
Why do you want to know that?

637
00:30:02,678 --> 00:30:05,445
Just paying proper attention
to a case I'm on.

638
00:30:06,050 --> 00:30:07,931
His body was shipped
to New York.

639
00:30:08,016 --> 00:30:09,367
I knew him well enough to know

640
00:30:09,451 --> 00:30:11,402
that's where he wanted
his resting place to be.

641
00:30:11,486 --> 00:30:12,720
Mm.

642
00:30:13,590 --> 00:30:15,306
Could you provide me
with the location

643
00:30:15,390 --> 00:30:17,223
of his final destination?

644
00:30:17,559 --> 00:30:18,793
Of course.

645
00:30:26,168 --> 00:30:27,218
Very good.

646
00:30:27,302 --> 00:30:28,352
Thank you.

647
00:30:28,436 --> 00:30:29,621
If that is all?

648
00:30:29,705 --> 00:30:30,939
It is.

649
00:30:31,206 --> 00:30:32,440
For now.

650
00:30:34,109 --> 00:30:37,261
Well, I'm going to head
to the star bright club.

651
00:30:37,345 --> 00:30:39,164
There's been a robbery
there last night

652
00:30:39,248 --> 00:30:41,314
and the police have done
very little about it.

653
00:30:42,213 --> 00:30:44,814
The burden of running
a black business, I imagine.

654
00:30:53,128 --> 00:30:54,362
(Door opening)

655
00:31:01,003 --> 00:31:02,287
New York City?

656
00:31:02,371 --> 00:31:03,588
That's what she said.

657
00:31:03,672 --> 00:31:05,256
I've spoken with the railway

658
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:08,059
and they confirm they delivered
a coffin to that address.

659
00:31:08,143 --> 00:31:10,428
Well, I feel a trip
is in order,

660
00:31:10,512 --> 00:31:12,864
if only to eliminate him
as a suspect.

661
00:31:12,948 --> 00:31:15,500
Well, sir, a telephone call
would do the same.

662
00:31:15,584 --> 00:31:17,302
I believe Watts is there.

663
00:31:17,386 --> 00:31:18,919
I need to talk to him.

664
00:31:19,688 --> 00:31:21,387
I threatened to reveal
his secret.

665
00:31:22,190 --> 00:31:23,276
Sir?

666
00:31:23,361 --> 00:31:24,386
It was rash.

667
00:31:24,471 --> 00:31:26,677
I was angry and I need
to make it right.

668
00:31:26,761 --> 00:31:28,413
And there's more:

669
00:31:28,497 --> 00:31:30,982
A private detective
is looking for Jack Walker.

670
00:31:31,066 --> 00:31:33,399
He wants to take
his child away from him.

671
00:31:33,969 --> 00:31:35,635
I feel I need to warn them.

672
00:31:45,847 --> 00:31:47,131
Thank you, Julia.

673
00:31:47,215 --> 00:31:50,617
- Oh, for what?
- Uh! A most fulfilling day.

674
00:31:51,119 --> 00:31:52,552
You're most welcome.

675
00:31:53,322 --> 00:31:54,706
Margaret?
- Hm?

676
00:31:54,790 --> 00:31:56,841
Now that your children
have grown...

677
00:31:56,925 --> 00:31:59,244
Ah, well, one in jail,

678
00:31:59,328 --> 00:32:01,713
the other one
an itinerant actor.

679
00:32:01,797 --> 00:32:05,049
Are you sure you'd like me
to look after your child?

680
00:32:05,133 --> 00:32:07,652
Oh. That's not
what I was suggesting.

681
00:32:07,736 --> 00:32:09,870
Oh. I see.

682
00:32:10,029 --> 00:32:13,091
I was thinking of starting
a nurse-in-training program

683
00:32:13,175 --> 00:32:14,792
and you'd be an excellent
candidate.

684
00:32:14,876 --> 00:32:16,210
Me?

685
00:32:16,578 --> 00:32:18,177
Why not you?

686
00:32:19,081 --> 00:32:21,132
Margaret nightingale.

687
00:32:21,216 --> 00:32:22,600
If you wish.

688
00:32:22,684 --> 00:32:24,083
(Grunts)
Margaret!

689
00:32:25,387 --> 00:32:27,053
Are you all right?

690
00:32:27,689 --> 00:32:29,322
I just need to lay down.

691
00:32:30,225 --> 00:32:32,025
Margaret, get a bed ready.

692
00:32:33,128 --> 00:32:34,594
Who did this to you?

693
00:32:35,330 --> 00:32:37,248
Please, I just need
to lie down.

694
00:32:37,332 --> 00:32:38,932
(Crying)

695
00:32:40,769 --> 00:32:42,003
(Moaning)

696
00:32:49,044 --> 00:32:50,943
(Eerie music)

697
00:33:03,058 --> 00:33:04,424
Anybody there?

698
00:33:26,915 --> 00:33:29,982
"A cat is not the only thing
with nine lives."

699
00:33:37,759 --> 00:33:38,993
(Sighing)

700
00:33:39,321 --> 00:33:41,144
Oh! There's your mother now.

701
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:42,494
Oh.

702
00:33:43,046 --> 00:33:45,115
How was your first day
back at the clinic?

703
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:48,868
Oh, trying.
But it's good to be back.

704
00:33:49,904 --> 00:33:52,071
(Sighing)
- You seem troubled.

705
00:33:53,241 --> 00:33:56,294
A woman came into the clinic
just as we were closing.

706
00:33:56,378 --> 00:33:57,977
Badly bruised.

707
00:33:58,359 --> 00:34:01,032
She said she'd fallen down
a flight of stairs.

708
00:34:01,116 --> 00:34:02,166
Ah.

709
00:34:02,250 --> 00:34:04,217
And I take it that
wasn't the case.

710
00:34:05,687 --> 00:34:07,872
I've seen enough bruising
in my life

711
00:34:07,956 --> 00:34:09,307
to know that she was lying.

712
00:34:09,391 --> 00:34:11,224
She was assaulted.

713
00:34:12,794 --> 00:34:14,761
Would you like me
to speak with her?

714
00:34:15,330 --> 00:34:16,564
Oh.

715
00:34:17,666 --> 00:34:20,567
I'll speak with her, see if
I can get her to come through.

716
00:34:22,670 --> 00:34:25,390
Aw, anyway, don't you have
a zombie to catch?

717
00:34:25,474 --> 00:34:26,907
Oh, yes.

718
00:34:28,043 --> 00:34:29,942
Oh, my love.

719
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:33,598
I promise that mama and papa

720
00:34:33,682 --> 00:34:36,916
are going to take care of you
no matter what.

721
00:34:37,952 --> 00:34:39,619
Protect you always.

722
00:34:41,423 --> 00:34:43,608
- George!
- Good grief!

723
00:34:43,692 --> 00:34:44,942
Why are you two here?

724
00:34:45,026 --> 00:34:47,245
To make you feel better.

725
00:34:47,329 --> 00:34:49,313
That's a laugh.
If you don't mind.

726
00:34:49,397 --> 00:34:51,392
- No. Let us speak.
- Why should I?

727
00:34:51,477 --> 00:34:53,785
Nothing good seems to come
of it when you open your mouth.

728
00:34:53,869 --> 00:34:56,087
George Crab Tree, your manners!

729
00:34:56,171 --> 00:35:01,426
We wish...
To throw you a party!

730
00:35:01,510 --> 00:35:03,294
A party? Are you mad?

731
00:35:03,378 --> 00:35:05,763
Well, it is your birthday
in three days.

732
00:35:05,847 --> 00:35:08,026
We should celebrate.
- With family.

733
00:35:08,111 --> 00:35:09,567
It's the least we can do.

734
00:35:09,651 --> 00:35:12,303
Well, I'm sorry.
I'm not interested.

735
00:35:12,481 --> 00:35:14,848
Now, if you don't mind,
I have to work tomorrow.

736
00:35:16,424 --> 00:35:17,741
Party?

737
00:35:17,825 --> 00:35:19,126
If you don't mind.

738
00:35:22,864 --> 00:35:24,048
(Sighing)

739
00:35:24,132 --> 00:35:25,366
Excuse me.

740
00:35:26,201 --> 00:35:27,501
Hello, miss new some.

741
00:35:29,137 --> 00:35:30,588
Thank you for coming, Henry.

742
00:35:30,672 --> 00:35:33,105
I... don't know
how I can help you.

743
00:35:33,675 --> 00:35:35,059
Henry, I'm desperate.

744
00:35:35,143 --> 00:35:36,460
Well, I can see that.

745
00:35:36,544 --> 00:35:37,844
You called me.

746
00:35:39,581 --> 00:35:41,915
How well do you know
George's family?

747
00:35:42,717 --> 00:35:44,402
Only what he has told me
about them.

748
00:35:44,486 --> 00:35:45,903
Didn't you meet them all?

749
00:35:45,987 --> 00:35:49,340
Yes, but it was only
a quick visit last year

750
00:35:49,424 --> 00:35:51,109
and they all seemed
pleasant enough.

751
00:35:51,193 --> 00:35:52,892
Even the scary witch?

752
00:35:53,929 --> 00:35:56,323
Well, she didn't present
herself as such at the time.

753
00:35:57,131 --> 00:35:59,098
So, you know nothing about them?

754
00:36:00,101 --> 00:36:04,322
I know a few of them are...
Ladies of easy virtue.

755
00:36:04,406 --> 00:36:06,257
And George thinks
very highly of them.

756
00:36:06,341 --> 00:36:08,826
Yes. Well, that's plain
as day, isn't it?

757
00:36:08,910 --> 00:36:11,143
He left me at the altar
because of them.

758
00:36:11,711 --> 00:36:13,939
Henry, can you talk
to the new found land police

759
00:36:14,024 --> 00:36:16,458
and find out everything
you can about them?

760
00:36:18,253 --> 00:36:19,570
You don't trust them?

761
00:36:19,654 --> 00:36:23,440
George and I met most of them
when we went last year.

762
00:36:23,524 --> 00:36:25,076
There was no hint of this curse,

763
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:27,650
even though it was clear
that George and I were together.

764
00:36:27,930 --> 00:36:29,697
I'll do what I can.

765
00:36:31,199 --> 00:36:33,284
So, we're a team, then?

766
00:36:33,368 --> 00:36:35,453
For better or worse.

767
00:36:35,537 --> 00:36:36,771
Hm.

768
00:36:40,675 --> 00:36:41,726
Good day.

769
00:36:41,810 --> 00:36:43,361
Thank you, Henry.

770
00:36:43,445 --> 00:36:46,112
(Door opening and closing)

771
00:36:47,815 --> 00:36:49,716
(♪)

772
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:53,604
You didn't open it?

773
00:36:53,688 --> 00:36:55,388
I sure did not.

774
00:36:56,557 --> 00:36:57,742
You want to stand back.

775
00:36:57,826 --> 00:36:59,792
This is not
for the faint-hearted.

776
00:37:09,504 --> 00:37:11,738
What's that supposed to mean?

777
00:37:12,607 --> 00:37:15,875
It means... someone's
pulled a fast one.

778
00:37:45,273 --> 00:37:46,424
Detective Murdoch.

779
00:37:46,508 --> 00:37:47,725
Miss Cherry.

780
00:37:47,809 --> 00:37:50,228
Anything to report on
the murderous zombie?

781
00:37:50,312 --> 00:37:53,197
Other than the fact that I am
not pursuing a murderous zombie?

782
00:37:53,281 --> 00:37:54,332
No.

783
00:37:54,416 --> 00:37:56,649
So, he can run free
on the streets?

784
00:37:57,685 --> 00:37:58,985
Miss Cherry.

785
00:37:59,123 --> 00:38:00,371
Constable Higgins.

786
00:38:00,455 --> 00:38:02,522
You are... well?

787
00:38:04,392 --> 00:38:05,858
What do you want?

788
00:38:06,895 --> 00:38:09,547
Do you have any friends
at the tribune in St. John's?

789
00:38:09,631 --> 00:38:10,896
I may.

790
00:38:11,899 --> 00:38:14,266
May I impose upon you
a favour then?

791
00:38:15,303 --> 00:38:18,404
As long as you remember
my golden rule: Tit for tat.

792
00:38:24,746 --> 00:38:27,231
We should cancel
our subscription to this rag.

793
00:38:27,315 --> 00:38:28,781
Is that so?

794
00:38:29,317 --> 00:38:30,668
Look at this drivel.

795
00:38:30,752 --> 00:38:33,404
Miss Louise Cherry
has clearly lost her mind.

796
00:38:33,488 --> 00:38:35,921
Who would believe such rubbish?

797
00:38:36,458 --> 00:38:38,342
Miss Cherry is not stupid.

798
00:38:38,426 --> 00:38:40,244
You think it could be true?

799
00:38:40,328 --> 00:38:41,547
I don't know.

800
00:38:41,632 --> 00:38:43,365
I don't know what to think.

801
00:38:44,666 --> 00:38:45,998
Look at this.

802
00:38:48,870 --> 00:38:51,388
- What on earth is this?
- I don't know.

803
00:38:51,472 --> 00:38:54,040
- Who left it?
- No idea.

804
00:38:54,553 --> 00:38:56,738
- You can't think...
- Don't be foolish.

805
00:38:57,112 --> 00:38:58,644
He's dead.

806
00:39:03,609 --> 00:39:05,027
So you are going
to pursue this?

807
00:39:05,112 --> 00:39:07,003
I'm just going
to ask a few questions.

808
00:39:07,088 --> 00:39:09,064
Even though Trevor told you
to let the matter lie?

809
00:39:09,149 --> 00:39:11,542
I won't involve him
or the police.

810
00:39:11,743 --> 00:39:13,110
(Knocking on door)

811
00:39:13,828 --> 00:39:15,813
Must be Timothy and the gang.

812
00:39:15,897 --> 00:39:17,797
Please don't bring up
the robbery.

813
00:39:22,904 --> 00:39:24,671
I need to talk to you two.

814
00:39:27,909 --> 00:39:29,609
Well, it's simple.

815
00:39:30,044 --> 00:39:31,310
We'll just leave.

816
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:33,597
And he's following you?

817
00:39:33,681 --> 00:39:34,932
He's in New York.

818
00:39:35,016 --> 00:39:36,834
He didn't follow me here.
I lost him.

819
00:39:36,918 --> 00:39:38,389
But it's just
a matter of time.

820
00:39:38,474 --> 00:39:39,708
Probably.

821
00:39:40,488 --> 00:39:41,954
What do you suggest?

822
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:45,242
Well, he seems like the kind
of man who could be bought.

823
00:39:45,327 --> 00:39:46,711
So, no legal recourse?

824
00:39:46,895 --> 00:39:48,828
For your kind, likely no.

825
00:39:49,571 --> 00:39:52,625
That's why I told you to stay
out of this Trevor business.

826
00:39:53,156 --> 00:39:56,020
But I do appreciate you taking
the time to warn us about this.

827
00:39:56,104 --> 00:39:57,338
Of course.

828
00:39:57,939 --> 00:39:59,972
I couldn't use
your telephone, could I?

829
00:40:08,416 --> 00:40:11,335
Yes, uh, station house four.

830
00:40:11,419 --> 00:40:13,270
Toronto, Ontario
and I'd like to speak

831
00:40:13,354 --> 00:40:15,421
to detective
William Murdoch, please.

832
00:40:15,890 --> 00:40:17,941
Let the fun begin.

833
00:40:18,025 --> 00:40:20,559
I do hope Samuel is tucked in
for the evening?

834
00:40:21,896 --> 00:40:23,680
Sir, are you quite sure?

835
00:40:23,764 --> 00:40:25,149
The coffin was empty?

836
00:40:25,233 --> 00:40:27,551
It was and the recipient
had no knowledge

837
00:40:27,635 --> 00:40:29,219
of why it was delivered to him.

838
00:40:29,303 --> 00:40:31,688
Did he have any knowledge
of a Maurice majors?

839
00:40:31,772 --> 00:40:33,857
- No.
- So, Mrs. Hart is definitely

840
00:40:33,941 --> 00:40:36,409
up to something.
- It's possible.

841
00:40:37,312 --> 00:40:40,331
Well, any luck finding
Jack Walker?

842
00:40:40,415 --> 00:40:42,833
I've found them both.
Watts and Walker.

843
00:40:42,917 --> 00:40:45,035
Listen, Murdoch,
I'll be back in a day,

844
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:46,970
so right now I'm about to have
a drink with some lads,

845
00:40:47,054 --> 00:40:48,888
so I'll talk to you later.
Bye-bye.

846
00:40:51,058 --> 00:40:52,910
(Music playing)
- Good evening?

847
00:40:52,994 --> 00:40:54,945
- Hello.
- You have a name?

848
00:40:55,029 --> 00:40:57,248
- Thomas.
- Ah, well, Tom.

849
00:40:57,332 --> 00:40:58,620
I'm Tim.

850
00:40:58,705 --> 00:41:00,338
Let me grab you a drink.

851
00:41:22,823 --> 00:41:24,323
(Camera shutter clicking)

852
00:41:26,694 --> 00:41:28,061
(Camera shutter clicking)

853
00:41:31,832 --> 00:41:33,332
(Camera shutter clicking)

854
00:41:34,769 --> 00:41:36,335
(Camera shutter clicking)

855
00:41:37,638 --> 00:41:39,539
(Eerie music)

856
00:41:54,656 --> 00:41:55,955
You have a table?

857
00:41:57,458 --> 00:41:59,643
And don't tell me there
are no dogs allowed.

858
00:41:59,727 --> 00:42:01,110
I'm not an irishman, either.

859
00:42:01,313 --> 00:42:02,156
(Laughing)

860
00:42:02,241 --> 00:42:03,446
You're dead.

861
00:42:03,531 --> 00:42:04,882
Is that so?

862
00:42:05,382 --> 00:42:06,882
News to me.

863
00:42:07,468 --> 00:42:09,720
Hey, this animal and I
need sustenance.

864
00:42:09,805 --> 00:42:11,370
We're mighty hungry.

865
00:42:11,649 --> 00:42:14,902
You move when I say you move.

866
00:42:15,143 --> 00:42:17,027
Or I snap your neck
and this girl knows

867
00:42:17,111 --> 00:42:18,862
where her next meal's
coming from.

868
00:42:18,946 --> 00:42:21,013
- What do you want?
- What do you think?

869
00:42:23,585 --> 00:42:25,051
I want your money.

870
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:26,853
What is it they say?

871
00:42:27,521 --> 00:42:29,222
Your money or your life?

872
00:42:29,924 --> 00:42:31,524
I can't get you money.

873
00:42:32,159 --> 00:42:33,677
Not without Violet's permission.

874
00:42:33,761 --> 00:42:35,527
(Laughing)

875
00:42:36,097 --> 00:42:37,463
That's funny?

876
00:42:38,066 --> 00:42:40,066
Damn, I taught
that woman well!

877
00:42:42,870 --> 00:42:44,169
Well, then...

878
00:42:47,308 --> 00:42:49,141
You best get her permission.

879
00:42:50,244 --> 00:42:52,411
Or I'm going to choose
the second option.

880
00:42:53,714 --> 00:42:54,948
Son.

881
00:42:58,319 --> 00:43:00,953
(Dramatic music)

882
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:06,280
Come on, girl, take a seat.

883
00:43:06,365 --> 00:43:09,199
This fella's gonna
make us a decent meal.

884
00:43:16,270 --> 00:43:18,905
You were to come down for tea.

885
00:43:19,540 --> 00:43:20,925
I don't like doing this.

886
00:43:21,009 --> 00:43:22,192
George is a good man.

887
00:43:22,276 --> 00:43:24,055
I don't like to see him suffer.

888
00:43:24,140 --> 00:43:26,440
It won't be much longer.

889
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:28,265
His birthday
is fast approaching,

890
00:43:28,364 --> 00:43:30,583
and then it'll be over
and he can marry her

891
00:43:30,714 --> 00:43:33,147
and be as poor and happy
as he wants.

892
00:43:37,191 --> 00:43:39,192
(♪)

893
00:43:41,667 --> 00:43:43,667
Subtitling: Difuze
